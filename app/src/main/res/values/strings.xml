    <string name="article_text">When most people think of saving the world, they picture Superman swooping in at the last minute, bomb squads barely defusing deadly devices, and scientists discovering eleventh-hour miracle weapons to fend off alien hordes. But the real-life heroes who have saved the world have much better stories.
    \n\nWhile spur\-of\-the-moment heroics have sometimes rescued the planet, humanity has more often escaped destruction because of clear thinking and patience in the face of danger. Some acts of heroism have taken place over years or decades, the result of hard work and tireless labor. Other heroes died without ever even knowing what they had done or how it would be remembered.
    \n\nRegardless of how the act took place, it\’s safe to say that these eight real\-life heroes actually saved the world.
    \n\nOn Sept. 26, 1983, real-life hero Stanislav Petrov singlehandedly prevented a worldwide nuclear war when he followed his gut and chose to ignore a missile alarm.
    \n\nPetrov was a few hours into his shift as the duty officer at Serpukhov\-15, the secret command center outside Moscow that monitored Soviet military satellites over the United States. Suddenly the alarms went off, warning that five Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles had been launched from an American base.
    \n\nPetrov didn\’t panic. He knew that the alarm systems were in their early stages and personally believed the warning to be false \– though he later recalled that there was actually a 50\-50 chance that they weren\’t. Instead of reporting the missile attacks, Petrov turned the alarm off and told his supervisor that there had been a system malfunction.
